This set of scripts can take a set of explicit solvent simulations and measure the solvent distribution function (01_gr3), print out the input needed to run an IS-SPA simulation (02_atomic_parameters), and run an IS-SPA simulation given that parameter set (03_simulation).  Also included is the same procedure for the case of two charged LJ spheres (00_LJ_ions), which does not require a fitting procedure nor a simulation, but just a more straightforward integration of the forces.

See each directory individually for further details.
